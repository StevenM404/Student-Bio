                <p>My name is steven I am 20 years old and I have been playing with computers since 7th grade. I started with just playing simple games on the computer, but thenb i found a game i was interested in but couldnt run it.
                    I asked my dad why and he said that the PC was now powerful enough and said that you could build a pc out of this onbe or get a new one.
                    I decided to save money and get my first video card and from there I have alwaysed loved computers. I graduated high school 2 years ago and didnt like the idea of college so i wne into electrical and after almost two years i decided it wasnt for me.
                    I then signed up for this coding class because I have been on computers for many hours a day and whanted to more about them andn how applications function.
